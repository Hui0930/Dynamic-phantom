# Dynamic-phantom
Code to characterise and control dynamic phantom//
Use test_characterisation.py file to characterise the dynamic phantom//
The characterisation results are analysed and input signal for dynamic phantom modulation is generated by input_generator.m//
Modulation signals of different oxygenation saturation levels are generated by SpO2_input.m//
The dynamic phantom is modulated and reflected signal is measured by read_write.py
